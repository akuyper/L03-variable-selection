## Overview

The goals of this lab are to (1) learn to implement variable selection techniques using models we have learned and (2) introduce a new model type: support vector machines.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the questions provided in `LO3_variable_selection.html`. A template is provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L03.qmd).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which should contain a link to your github repo. Including the github repo link takes the place of having to submit the additional qmd and r files. See canvas for submission details.
